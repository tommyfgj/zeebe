 * Listener which will be invoked when a new snapshot is received by this follower from a leader.

 * the log is deleted and creates a new empty log. Hence any consumers of the log may have to reset
 * its internal state so that it can start with a new log and a new snapshot.
 *
 * <p>The difference between this listener and {@link
 * io.camunda.zeebe.snapshots.PersistedSnapshotListener} is that {@link
 * io.camunda.zeebe.snapshots.PersistedSnapshotListener} notifies when a snapshot is taken locally
 * and when a snapshot is received via replication. This listener only notifies when a snapshot is
 * received via raft replication, which happens only when the follower's log is lagging behind the
 * leader.
 *
 * <p>These listeners are invoked in the Raft thread. Hence it should not do any heavy computations.
 * Any time consuming steps should be delegated to another thread/actor.
